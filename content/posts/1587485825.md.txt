> If Google Shopping can start returning better results for products, and indeed results for more products, there’s an opportunity for the search giant to grow its share of shopping traffic and grab listings clicks from shoppers who might otherwise have run product queries directly on Amazon.

“For retailers, this change means free exposure to millions of people who come to Google every day for their shopping needs.
